# GreenPulse Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Document Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This PRD outlines the end-to-end requirements for GreenPulse (aligned with the BloomWatch concept as a Global Flowering Map), a climate-resilient platform leveraging NASA Earth observation data to track and predict flowering events globally. It addresses disruptions caused by climate change, such as irregular blooming leading to reduced agricultural yields, ecosystem imbalances, and challenges in pollination and pest management. The platform empowers farmers and researchers with actionable insights while supporting broader climate studies.

As a software engineer-focused PRD, it emphasizes scalable architecture, user-centric design, business viability, and technical feasibility. It covers functional and non-functional requirements, user flows, and edge cases, incorporating the specified features (e.g., interactive global maps with bloom hotspots by region and crop/plant type, predictive alerts, multi-language support, optional SMS for rural farmers) and expanding to unlisted factors like data privacy, monetization, and multi-stakeholder integration. Adjustments from the prior PRD include global scope, explicit NASA data sources (MODIS, Landsat, VIIRS), and a broader focus on flowering events across crops and wild plants.

### 1.2 Scope
**In Scope**: Web/mobile dashboard with global interactive map, NASA data processing (MODIS for vegetation indices, Landsat for high-res imagery, VIIRS for night-time bloom detection), multilingual support, predictive alerts (web/push/SMS), user subscriptions.

**Out of Scope**: Physical hardware (e.g., IoT sensors), full e-commerce for inputs, real-time user-uploaded imagery (though designed for future integration).

**Version**: 1.0 (MVP for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025, with post-hackathon roadmap for global expansion).

### 1.3 Assumptions and Dependencies
**Assumptions**: Access to NASA open datasets via Earthdata API (MODIS, Landsat, VIIRS for global coverage); reliable SMS gateways worldwide (e.g., Twilio); users have basic mobile access.

**Dependencies**: Third-party APIs (NASA, weather services like OpenWeatherMap for supplementary data); compliance with global data laws (e.g., GDPR, NDPR).

**Risks**: Data gaps in remote areas (mitigated by AI interpolation); varying SMS costs by region (fallback to app notifications); low adoption in non-English regions (addressed via multi-language).

## 2. Business Objectives

### 2.1 Value Proposition
GreenPulse provides a global flowering map to:
- Enable farmers to optimize harvests, manage pollination, and control pests through bloom predictions.
- Support researchers in climate change studies by tracking ecosystem shifts.
- Foster global inclusivity with SMS alerts for rural users, potentially increasing agricultural efficiency by 20-30% (based on similar ag-tech benchmarks).

### 2.2 Target Market
**Primary**: Farmers worldwide (focus on smallholders in emerging markets like Nigeria, India, Brazil); researchers/academics in ecology/climate fields.

**Secondary**: Governments/NGOs (e.g., FAO, WWF for policy), agribusinesses, environmental educators.

**Market Size**: Global agriculture ($4T+); biodiversity/climate tech ($100B+); climate impacts on flowering could cost billions in losses annually.

### 2.3 Monetization Strategy
**Freemium Model**: Free basic access (global maps, predictions); premium subscriptions ($2-10/month) for advanced alerts, detailed analytics, API access.

**Partnerships**: Revenue from research grants (NASA/UN), ads from ag-suppliers, government contracts for climate data.

**Grants**: Initial funding via NASA/hackathon, followed by sustainability-focused grants (e.g., Gates Foundation, EU Horizon).

### 2.4 Success Metrics
**User Adoption**: 50,000 active users in first year; 60% retention.

**Impact**: Surveys showing improved harvest planning; contributions to 10+ climate studies.

**Business**: 25% premium conversion; partnerships with 10+ entities.

**Technical**: 99% uptime; <2s map load time globally.

## 3. User Personas and Actors

### 3.1 Primary Actors
**Farmer (End-User)**: E.g., Maria, 50, smallholder in Brazil growing coffee. Rural, limited internet; uses feature phones. **Needs**: Bloom hotspot maps, predictive alerts for pollination/pest control. **Pain Points**: Climate unpredictability, language barriers.

**Researcher/Academic**: E.g., Dr. Singh, ecologist in India. **Needs**: Global data exports, predictive models for studies on flowering shifts. **Pain Points**: Fragmented datasets, lack of real-time global views.

### 3.2 Secondary Actors
**Government Official/Policymaker**: E.g., UN climate analyst. **Needs**: Aggregated global dashboards for policy on food security/ecosystems.

**NGO/Conservationist**: Field workers using alerts for biodiversity protection.

**Admin/Platform Operator**: Internal team managing data updates, moderation.

**Consumer (Indirect)**: Public users accessing basic maps for educational purposes.

### 3.3 External Factors
**Regulatory**: Compliance with international data privacy (GDPR, etc.), environmental treaties.

**Environmental**: Global climate variability; platform must handle diverse ecosystems (e.g., tropical vs. temperate flowering).

**Socio-Economic**: Digital divide; multi-language and SMS ensure equity across regions.

**Competitive Landscape**: Differentiate from tools like NASA Harvest by adding global flowering-specific predictions and rural SMS alerts.
