**Human Decisions:**
- Color scheme (#7ED321 green for branding)
- Layout structure (3-column map view)
- User flow design (Search → Map → Insights)
- Feature prioritization

---

### **4. Data Visualization**

**What AI Helped With:**
- Recharts integration examples
- Chart configuration syntax
- Data transformation for charts
- Legend and tooltip configurations

**Human Contribution:**
- Selected which data to visualize (NDVI trends)
- Designed 6-month tracking approach
- Chose core crops to track (Maize, Wheat, Coffee)
- Created data structure for 8 monitored regions

---

### **5. Documentation**

**What AI Helped With:**
- Markdown formatting
- Documentation structure suggestions
- Technical writing clarity improvements
- README template suggestions

**Human Input:**
- Product Requirements Document (PRD) concept and requirements
- Project vision and goals
- Target market definition (smallholder farmers)
- Business model and monetization strategy
- NASA Space Apps Challenge alignment

---

### **6. Bug Fixes and Debugging**

**What AI Helped With:**
- Identifying TypeScript errors
- Suggesting fixes for React hooks dependencies
- Mobile responsiveness issues
- Build optimization suggestions

**Human Debugging:**
- Testing features on actual devices
- Verifying NASA data displays correctly
- Ensuring filters work as expected
- Performance optimization decisions

---

## What AI Did NOT Do

### **Original Contributions by Human Team:**

1. **Concept and Vision**
   - GreenPulse idea and mission
   - Focus on flowering pattern prediction
   - Target audience identification (farmers + researchers)

2. **NASA Data Strategy**
   - Decision to use MODIS Terra specifically
   - Choice of NDVI, Temperature, and EVI layers
   - 8 global monitoring regions selection

3. **Feature Design**
   - Dual filtering system (crop + intensity)
   - Auto-zoom to searched location
   - Alert subscription workflow
   - Bloom prediction methodology

4. **Architecture Decisions**
   - React + TypeScript + Vite stack
   - Leaflet for mapping
   - NASA GIBS as primary data source
   - Component structure and organization

5. **Data Analysis**
   - NDVI threshold interpretation (0.7+ = peak bloom)
   - Crop-region associations (Maize-Nigeria, Wheat-India, etc.)
   - Prediction timeframes (7-90 days)
   - Temperature correlation logic

6. **Testing and Validation**
   - All features tested by human developers
   - Mobile responsiveness verified manually
   - NASA data accuracy confirmed
   - User flow validation

## AI Usage Breakdown

### **Estimated Percentage by Category:**

- **Code Structure (40%):** AI-assisted, human-designed
- **NASA Integration (20%):** AI-researched, human-implemented
- **UI/UX (30%):** AI-suggested, human-refined
- **Documentation (10%):** AI-formatted, human-authored

### **Overall:**
- **AI Contribution:** ~35-40% (acceleration and assistance)
- **Human Contribution:** ~60-65% (design, logic, decisions)

**AI was used as a productivity tool, not as the creator.**
